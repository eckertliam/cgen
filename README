# C Generator

This is a simple C code generator. It is designed to be used as a backend for compilers that need to generate C code. It does not attempt to be a full C code generator, but rather a simple tool to help with the generation of C code. It is also a WIP and will be likely forever. 

## Capabilities
- Generate C code for functions, structs, enums, and global variables
